# Suzan Taha's Webpage
This is a page where I'll share some information about myself and the work I am doing in BioInformatics. So far, I've done some work to analyza data on penguins, and I've also done some work on food consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.  

## Work With Penguins
I started learning how to use R by working with the Palmer Penguins data set. We ran an analysis using a small subset of 44 penguins. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://suzantaha.github.io/suzantaha/BioStatisticsAnalysis/PalmerPenguins_Initial.html).
