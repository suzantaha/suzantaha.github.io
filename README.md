# Suzan Taha's Webpage

Hi! (:

Welcome to my page, where I will put all of my work I have completed not only for my BioInformatics course but over the past year. I have done some exploratory analysis on penguins, squirrels, and CO2 emissions. I have also used R to look at DNA replication in the goal of finding the origin and DNAa box. In some models we are going to look at regression, specifically for CO2 emissions in correlation with vehicles in Canada. Lastly, I have included my REU project where the spread of Influenza on Multi-pen Pig farms was researched and evaluted. 

## Work With Penguins
I started learning how to use R by working with the Palmer Penguins data set. We ran an analysis using a small subset of 44 penguins. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://suzantaha.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/PalmerPenguins_Initial.html).

## Exploratory Analysis on Food Consumption and C02
Secondly, I began a exploratory analysis on a data set given on github to create visual representations of how food consumption correlates with c02 emissions. In the data set we have multiple categories of food and we are examining how each country has their own contribution to the c02 emissions. You can see my analysis [here](https://suzantaha.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/FoodConsumptionCO2.html).

## Exploratory Analysis NYC squirrels 
The last exploratory analysis I completed was on a dataset from github focusing on the squirrels in New York City. Some variables used here were fur color, time the squirrel was seen, what they were doing, etc. If intersted, you can see my analysis [here](https://suzantaha.github.io/NYCsquirrels.html).

## Replication DNA
In the second part of the BioInformatics course, we used R to mimic DNA replication and help us find the replication origin, specifically the DNAa box. In this code we create multiple functions that allow us to find the complementary strand, a certain number of nucleotides, how frequent they are seen. etc. If you are interested in learning more, click [here](https://suzantaha.github.io/Replication_Suzan_Taha.html).

## The Epidemiology of the Influenza A Virus Applied to Multi Pen Pig Farms
Over the summer of 2022, I was apart of a research program for undergraduates with NSF at Elon and N&C state university. My partner and I focused on how the Influenza A Vrius spreads within multi-pen Pig farms. Influenza A virus is a major concern in pork production. Influenza does not only affect our swine markets around the world, but it also affects swine care-givers as well as the greater population. In this study, the focus is on the dynamics of swine herds in order to understand the spread of influenza. Understanding the epidemiology of influenza will further support efforts in decreasing infected swine populations and preventing an ongoing pandemic. MATLAB and ode45 have helped develop fully continuous mathematical models that represent a multi-pen pig farm. These models allow us to examine the differences in model dynamics between the populations of pigs separated by age, resulting in the use of one, two and four class models. Three basic SEIR models were constructed to understand the spread of influenza in swine herds. To learn more click [here](https://suzantaha.github.io/REUPAPER.pdf).
