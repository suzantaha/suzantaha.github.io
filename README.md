# Suzan Taha's Webpage
This is a page where I'll share some information about myself and the work I am doing in BioInformatics. So far, I've done some work to analyza data on penguins, and I've also done some work on food consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.  

## Work With Penguins
I started learning how to use R by working with the Palmer Penguins data set. We ran an analysis using a small subset of 44 penguins. If you are interested, you can see my analysis [here](https://suzantaha.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/PalmerPenguins_Initial.html).

## Exploratory Analysis on Food Consumption and C02
I began a exploratory analysis on the data set given on github to create visual representations of how food consumption correlates with c02 emissions. In the data set we have multiple categories of food and we are examining how each country has their own contribution to the c02 emissions. You can see my analysis [here](https://suzantaha.github.io/BioStatisticsAnalysis/FoodConsumptionCO2.html).
